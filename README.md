# Polldancer

Polldancer is a long poller service that gracefully dances to webhooks. We believe in humor and respect, so let's keep it light-hearted and inclusive.

## Introduction

Polldancer is a Go application that polls a remote service at regular intervals and forwards the received data to a webhook. It leverages the power of Go concurrency to efficiently handle multiple long-polling requests and gracefully dance to the rhythm of webhooks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later
- Python 3.x (for running the webhook server)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polldancer.git
   cd polldancer
   ```

2. Build the `polldancer` binary:

   ```bash
   make polldancer
   ```

### Usage

Polldancer provides various options for running the application using the provided Makefile.

- **Running the Application**:

  To run Polldancer:

  ```bash
  make run
  ```

  This will start the Polldancer application, which will continuously poll a remote service and forward the data to the configured webhook.

- **Running Tests**:

  To run the tests:

  ```bash
  make test
  ```

  This will execute the tests and ensure the application behaves as expected.

- **Cleaning**:

  To clean up the project directory:

  ```bash
  make clean
  ```

  This will remove the `polldancer` binary and clean the Go cache.

- **Daemon Mode**:

  To run Polldancer as a daemon (in the background):

  ```bash
  make daemon
  ```

  This will start the Polldancer application as a daemon process, allowing it to run continuously in the background.

- **Tidying Dependencies**:

  To tidy and verify Go module dependencies:

  ```bash
  make tidy
  ```

  This will ensure that the Go module dependencies are properly managed and verified.

- **Running the Webhook Server**:

  To run the webhook server (required for Polldancer to forward data):

  ```bash
  make run-webhook-server
  ```

  This will start the webhook server, allowing it to receive and process forwarded data.

- **Stopping the Webhook Server**:

  To stop the webhook server:

  ```bash
  make stop-webhook-server
  ```

  This will gracefully stop the webhook server.
